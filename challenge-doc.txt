Start by taking a look at the data we make available via our public API http://build.kiva.org/api

 

Task 1

With this information create a script (using any language you feel most comfortable in) that queries the API for funded status loans, e.g. http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/search.json?status=funded

 

Choose a loan from the list and pull its information, e.g. http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/300000.json

 

Then, also pull a list of that loanâ€™s lenders, e.g http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/300000/lenders.json

 

There is more background information on the API and its use on build.kiva.org as well as at https://github.com/kiva/API

 

Task 2

 

Use the loan information you gathered above ( e.g:  "loan_amount":100 (in USD), "repayment_term":7 (in months)) to build out a loan repayment schedule into a database table.  

 

Then use the list of lenders and determine an estimated repayment schedule for each one. Create a database schema to hold this information and a script that distributes the repayments equally across the lenders. This creates an audit trail that each lender received back the amount they put into the loan.

 

Example, Kevin and Nina are two lenders to a loan for $100 and each purchased $50 each and they should both be repaid that amount over the course of the repayment schedule (e.g. 7 months).

 

Then, write unit tests for the code as well as an integrity test for the data that ensures each lender got back their expected amount over the course of the loan.

 

There is no requirement on using a certain language and including frameworks/libraries is fine. Use the best tool for you.
